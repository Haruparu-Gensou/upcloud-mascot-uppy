# Meet the Upcloud Mascot!
Meet Uppy, the Upcloud mascot!

Uppy was inspired by some thread in Bluesky between Gensou/Usabon and the official Upcloud account. Here, you'll see the official assets for Uppy, which are mostly in raster. A vector version will be avaliable!

*Where's all the graphics?*
They're coming soon, trust me- I mean us. 

# About Uppy
Uppy is an arctic fox (in permanent winter morph) with a purple cable wrapped around her - yes, Uppy is female - tail. The way the cable is wrapped resembles the Upcloud logo.

She's very curious and playful, to say the least. Sometimes she can be a little bit credulous, but at most times, skeptical and strategic. However, she may get carried away in her thoughts and end up not coming to a conclusion.

# Notes
Uppy is an adult. 
You can use her almost anywhere; just don't use her in stuff thats offensive, political, or just downright wrong/illegal.
